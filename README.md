# discord-bot
-------
a discord bot my friends and I use on our private discord server. 'whistleblower.py' is the main file here where everything runs from.

# Purpose
This bot was originally made as a joke to test my web scraping skills when I was first experimenting with that more. The bot's original purpose was to track stock trades made by government officials (specifically Nancy Pelosi) for possible insider info. It then evolved into a more robust chaotic multipurpose bot used to just make the server more fun and interesting; from changing server nicknames to randomly playing music at arbitrary intervals. It does a lot of goofy stuff and is merely just a goofy play area.
